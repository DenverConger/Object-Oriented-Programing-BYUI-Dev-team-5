This is a prototype game designed help everyone reminisce the good old days of the original top-down Zelda games.

Requirements:
Arcade needs to be installed on your computer.
 To do that, please go to the following website for instructions:
https://arcade.academy/installation_windows.html
This program also relies on the os and math libraries for python. These come by default with python, though, so you don't really need to worry about that. Just install python 3.8 or 3.9 via python.org.

To run in the command line, please change your working directory to the root path via the 'cd' command and type 'py main.py'. Or you can just double-click on the main.py file.
