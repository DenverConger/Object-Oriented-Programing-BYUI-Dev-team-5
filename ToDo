#enemies and ai for enemies
"""
Denver Conger's thoughts on enemies
breakdown for enemy stuff
Prob gonna use a simple state machine to get an enemy ai running

in order to accomplish this the idea is to get a working enemy object on the screen. THan I plan on creating a few different
states or controllers which are objects that can act and react depending on how we program it.
classes needed to program for alpha


enemy classes
   which includes velicity conrol prob just to creep towards player
"""
#player and health
#map/obstacles tiles and obstacle collision
#item interaction and simple inventory

#basics for game
#1. player and enemies and collisions with enemy attacks and simple ai for enemies

-----------------------------------------
Alpha:
Player cannnot move past walls

Week 10:
Develop Beta:
-Interaction with Enemy and Player
---Be shot at
-Bigger Arena with scrolling, make map files
-Shooting out from player (constant or clicking?)
-Start plan and thinking about classes


Think about for later:
-Scrolling Screen
---One big square arena, or multiple rooms that we change views from?
---Scroll screen with player, or scroll with rooms?
-Items
-Inventory
-Sword Attack
-Boss Level
-Longer you stay at level 1, the more enemies spawn. If you get too greedy, then you might get swarmed. 
-Art
-View
